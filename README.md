# Crossfit-card
A simple weight tracking card for Crossfit

You can view the card [here](http://boriskozo.github.io/crossfit-card/index.html?weightStart=20&weightJump=5&weightEnd=100)

Parameters (change in the URL):
weightStart - The starting weight of the table
weightEnd - The ending weight of the table
weightJump - The weight diffrence between ticks in the table

Important: This is just a POC hack and in no way reflects my usual code writing.
